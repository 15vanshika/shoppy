Shoppy is a responsive e-commerce website that offers a user-friendly shopping experience. Key features include interactive navigation, visually appealing design, detailed product views, and a user-friendly checkout process. My contributions involved JavaScript interactivity, error handling, and a "Connect" feature for user engagement.
